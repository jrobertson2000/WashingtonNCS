This repository holds supplemental files from "Leveraging the potential of nature to meet net zero greenhouse gas emissions in Washington State" (Robertson et al., in review).

The following is a list of supplemental files, and see the ReadMe files associated with them for more descriptive information:

<table>
<thead><tr><th>FileName</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td> Supplemental Table S1.csv	</td><td>Detailed description of scenarios used to calculate each pathway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Table S2.csv	</td><td>Data used as inputs to the R code, including baseline rates of each pathway activity, coefficients of variation for Monte Carlo simulations, and sequestration rates of each activity per specified baseline unit. Actual input files are included separately as well. Sequestration rates for the Reforestation (Replanting After Wildfire) pathway can be found in Supplementary Table S3.csv.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Table S3.csv	</td><td>For input to the Reforestation (Replanting After Wildfire) pathway, including sequestration rates specific to years of the study period and fire severity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Table S4.csv </td><td>Evaluated results of Monte Carlo runs on each scenario in each year, statewide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Table S5.csv	</td><td>Evaluated results of Monte Carlo runs on each pathway activity per scenario in each year, statewide.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Table S6.csv	</td><td>Evaluated results of Monte Carlo runs on each scenario in each year, per county.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Table S7.csv	</td><td>Evaluated results of Monte Carlo runs on each pathway subactivity per scenario in each year, per county.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Table S8.csv	</td><td>Evaluated results of Monte Carlo runs on each pathway activity per scenario in each year, per county.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Table S9.xlsx	</td><td>Emissions reductions per area of each county in final year of model, from results in S8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Code S10.R	</td><td>Calculates CO2e sequestration of Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) pathways by county.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplemental Code S11.R	</td><td>Calculates median values and confidence intervals for unique combinations of input tables, here using columns named Scenario, ScenName, County, Activity, Subactivity, and Year.</td></tr>
